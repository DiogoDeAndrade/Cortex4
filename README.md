# THE CORTEX CHRONICLES, CHAPTER 4 - The Heist of Nyx Sterling

![TitleImage](screenshots/screen01.png)

Developed for the Game Creator's Club at Lusofona University.
This month, the theme was "New Year Resolution", so the game is about a heist during a new year's party.

This time, I'm using Godot 4. I'm still learning, so don't expect amazing code! :)

This is a part of what I hope will be "The Cortex Chronicles" - I want all the games I do for the Game Creator's Club this year to be linked together, hence this idea.
I also want to use a different engine on every entry, so let's see how that goes! :)

## Todo

- Add crowd in party zone
  - Talk to crowd
  - Pickpocket
- Add female guest
- "Cutscenes"
- Create labyrinth area
- Create secure room
- Improve ZX shader to use world-space UVs for the dithering effect
- Improve art overall (polish)
  - Party: decorations, city skyline
- Bugs
  - Camera control is wrong - something camera flips

## Art

Art was done by me (mostly with Asset Forge, and some Synty Studios props).
Some [Midjourney] was also used, all filtered with a shader I designed to give a [retro 3d look].
